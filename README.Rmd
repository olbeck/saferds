# saferds

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of saferds is to estimate changes in a college safe ride program using bayesian analysis. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of saferds from [GitHub](https://github.com/Olbeck80920/saferds) with:

``` r
install_github("olbeck80920/saferds")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Olbeck80920/saferds")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(saferds)
## basic example code

#Transform data into design matrix: 
XMat <-  model.matrix(~ all_data_sim$Week + all_data_sim$Day +      all_data_sim$Week*all_data_sim$Day)



```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
